That’s where the real magic lies. It's the silent engine powering every model you’ve ever used, and it nearly broke me at first.\n\nOnce I wrapped my head around it, implementing layers was easy — just more neurons bundled together, abstracted into units. But then I stumbled upon batching. I had no clue what it was… until my simple model took 10 minutes on basic datasets. Turns out batching wasn’t optional — it was critical.\n\nThis was just the beginning!"

But as I kept reading, I stumbled on CNNs — and every post said they give way better accuracy.\n\nSo, high on that dopamine rush, I dove headfirst into convolutional layers.\n\nDebugging the math behind kernels was brutal. I had a rough idea of how they worked, but implementing them was a whole different beast. I took a peek at some open-source examples online and pieced things together. But it got crazy real fast — I ended up with a 5-deep for-loop 💀, and unsurprisingly, training time exploded to 5+ hours on simple data.\n\nThat’s when I knew — I had to vectorize the operations.

I “cheated” too.\n\nI plugged in PyTorch convolutions to speed things up, but to be fair — I still implemented other low-level stuff myself, like im2col and col2im, to optimize my pipeline.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter all that madness — I hit 98% accuracy on MNIST. 🤯\nThat moment was pure validation.

I was expecting the model to easily get 9 out of 10 digits right.\n\nTurns out... I was completely wrong.\n\nThe model choked. It performed terribly.\n\nThat’s when it hit me — this was one of those moments. High accuracy on clean test data doesn’t always mean good real-world performance.\n\nSo I dove into production-related ML concepts and found out about data augmentation — subtly modifying inputs to make the model more robust and avoid overfitting.\n\nImplementing some of it was chill — flips, shifts, rotations. But zooming? That one gave me a headache 💀\n\nStill, it worked like a charm. After retraining with augmented data, my accuracy dropped slightly to 96.9%, but the model started generalizing way better.\n\nAnd finally, yes — it got 9/10 digits correct.\n\n🥳 Redemption.\n"

I built a quick TextManager class that used TfidfVectorizer to convert text into numbers. It was simple enough.\n\nSo I grabbed a dataset from Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/search], aiming to classify whether a piece of text contained hate speech or not. Easy, right? I already had Softmax, CrossEntropy, and the works from my earlier models.\n\nThen came the chaos.\n\nI tested it — and no matter what I typed, the model kept saying it was hate speech 😐\n\nI was confused. Like... what is this model on?!\n\nEventually, I asked the real MVP — ChatGPT — and it hit me with a new word: Class Imbalance. Turns out my dataset had an 85:15 ratio, with 85% of entries labeled as hate speech.\n\nThe dataset was scraped from Twitter.\nWhat did I expect 😔\n\nI learned that in such cases, your model can easily learn to just say “hate” for everything and still get high accuracy. I tried using class weights, tweaking loss functions — but even then, I couldn’t push accuracy beyond 20% on non-hate examples.\n\nThat’s when I realized... NLP isn’t just image classification with words.\nThere’s too much math. Too much chaos.\n\nAnd with that, I temporarily retired my NLP dreams. 🪦"

Learned about RNNs and LSTMs — don’t mind my tech jargon 😎. It was honestly a fun way to get back into things. I wrapped up that project, feeling good...\n\n...until YouTube betrayed me.\n\nRight after finishing the LSTM model, I got hit with:\n\n“Why RNNs Are Bad?”\n\n“What Replaced LSTMs?”\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME, YouTube? Why didn’t you show me this before?! 😭\n\nAnyway, I watched those, and that’s when I got introduced to attention layers — and of course, \"Attention is All You Need\".\n\nThat paper? 🔥 Wild. I dove into it, and with some help from online resources, I started building my own Transformer blocks, including things like MultiHeadAttentionLayer, feedforward layers, layer norms, the whole setup.\n\nI was excited again. Maybe... just maybe... I could build my own mini GPT at home.\n\nI already knew the kind of compute power required for LLMs, but that didn’t stop me. I trained a tiny version:\n\n~100k tokens\n\n~30k vocab\n\n~10 epochs\n\nAccuracy: ~30%\n\nEstimated time to train a “real” one: 67 days 💀\n\nTo squeeze out more performance, I even started looking into optimization techniques like matrix decomposition — especially for the value matrix in attention — to reduce computational overhead. Helped a bit, but not miracle-level.\n\nFeeling confident, I tried showing off how modular my framework had become by re-implementing my CNN model... but guess what?\n\nIt completely broke.\n\nTurns out my “framework” was just a single 1.1k-line Python file stitched together with dreams and duct tape 😂\n\nThe End!?\nMaybe.
