That’s where the real magic is. Once I understood it, building layers was straightforward — just abstracted groups of neurons.\n\nThen came batching. I had no clue what it was… until my model took 10 minutes per epoch. Turns out, batching wasn’t optional — it was necessary.\n\nThat was just the beginning!"

Since I already had Softmax and CrossEntropy, it felt easy.\n\nThen it all broke.\n\nNo matter what I typed — the model always said “hate speech.”\n\nTurns out the dataset was 85% hate, 15% normal.
